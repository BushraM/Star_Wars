# Star_Wars

Running the APP:

- The 'SW_API' folder contains the Laravel backend source code

- The 'SW_APP' contains the Angular frontend source code. You might need to update the laravel url depending on 
your locahost port. The default is set to "http://127.0.0.1:8000", if necessary, this will need to change in the following 3 files:
   - people.service.ts
   - starship.service.ts
   - plant.service.ts
